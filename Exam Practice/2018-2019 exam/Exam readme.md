Scala API

During the exam you may consult the Scala API at

Take tests seriously

Do not comment out tests in your test set. If your solution does not compile with the tests we provided, it will also not compile with the specification tests.
Spec Tests define Partial Grade

The Spec Tests are intended to check that your solution compiles against our tests and check basic properties of your solution. However, you should not assume that the Spec Tests are complete. You are responsible for reasoning about the correctness and completeness of your solution. We may determine the final grade by means of manual grading and/or additional Spec Tests.
