We have seen that case classes can be used to model lists,
and that pattern matching can then be used to decompose and inspect lists.

The Scala API already defines a List class for us with many useful functions.
These exercises demonstrate how to use Scala’s built-in lists.

During the course you will use pattern matching on lists a lot, so study this very well!

Note: If you receive a type mismatch error on the map argument, your argument consists of a tuple of two types whereas the provided function f expects two arguments.

Note: The “Test” tab contains tests for some of the functions you are asked to implement. You are encouraged (but not required) to write tests yourself for the others.
