In these exercises we will demonstrate some of the basic Scala syntax. 
If you receiving a RunningFailure, the code contains an infinite loop which is killed by WebLab.

    *
    * Let's elaborate each term in this function declaration:
    * 1: The name of the function
    * 2: The name of the first argument
    * 3: The type of the first argument. Types in Scala are always declared with a single colon (:)
    * 4: The return type of the function is a List with Ints
    * 5: The = sign separates the function signature from its implementation
    * 6: The implementation of this function always returns a list with 1, 2, 3, 4 in it.
    *    Notice that we do not have use the return keyword!

    * last evaluated expression of the function.

  /**
    * IMPORTANT NOTE ON VARIABLES:
    * The function above uses the 'val' keyword to create a 'value'.
    * Scala also has the 'var' keyword, which creates a 'variable'.
    *
    * The difference is that values are immutable, meaning you can never change them.
    * Variables on the other hand, can be changed after they have been declared.
    *
    * Immutable values give good software engineering benefits over their mutable counterpart:
    * data that should not need to change should be declared as immutable.
    * In general in this course we will apply a "principle of least power", and mainly work
    * in the functional programming subset of Scala, i.e., working with immutable data.
    *
    * Unless an exercise specifically calls for mutation, you should avoid it and
    * always use 'val' instead of 'var'.
    *
    * (Side note: the "principle of least power" is also the name of a popular style guide
    * for Scala programming: http://www.lihaoyi.com/post/StrategicScalaStylePrincipleofLeastPower.html)
